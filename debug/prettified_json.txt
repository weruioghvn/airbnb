Also, there was never any parking close or on the first floor.  The walk from the garage to the apartment is quite a hike, especially if you are carrying bags. The air bnb ad advertises \"Cable TV\"... However, there is no cable. It has roku but no subscriptions so you are left with very few channels. He did bring by an antennae but the reception was horrible and there wasnt much other than religious channels. There was a huge leak with the bathtub (no fault of the owners)...the maintenance team was slow to respond. However, the owner was very apologetic and refunded some money for the inconvenience. Pictures of the apt are accurate and it was clean. ",
