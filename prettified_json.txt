Within a two mile radius, there are Target, Walgreens, Safeway, Lucky, Sprouts, Chipotle, Panera, 7-11, Santa Clara Public Library, Peet's Coffee and halal and Indian grocery stores.  There is a convenience market a half a block down the street if you need milk or most any other convenience.\n\nWe are located a block away from a stop for public bus routes.  The Super Bowl bus will pick you up two blocks from our home!  We are biking distance to Santana Row and a walk to Santa Clara University.  We are located in a prime residential location with easy access to several major South Bay highways and expressways. Amtrak San Jose station is 45 minutes by bus and Caltrain Santa Clara Station is 20 minutes away via bus. Taxi from San Jose Mineta airport is 10-15 minutes.\n\nWe have a dog, but we will not allow guest pets.  Our dog is kept mostly inside and we will keep her on a leash when out front.  She is very obedient, quiet and friendly.\nWe will always provide you with clean linens and towels.  We will provide two sets of towels--if you need more, please let us know.  We can also provide extra blankets, if you need them. If you need additional utensils in the kitchen or toiletries in the bathroom, please let use know--we may be able to help you.",

The kitchen table comfortably seats two or can be used as a work space by business travelers. We also have new appliances including a dishwasher, full-sized refrigerator, microwave, and Keurig coffee maker.  In the attached private bathroom we provide luxury spa towels, toiletries, and updated features.  We offer free Wi-Fi, digital TV antenna, and Wi-Fi-connected Blu-Ray player.  The room has a cozy and quiet gas wall heater and an air conditioning unit and there is a private entrance for your convenience.\n\nIf you are bringing children, we offer a pack n' play or a blow up bed with bumpers with bedding included for your convenience.  We also now have a futon love seat that folds out to an extra twin size bed.  This all fits nicely near the main queen bed.\n\nYou will be able to access the cottage through a private entrance near the driveway parking spot through a side gate.\n\nWe will offer our help to make your stay more comfortable.  We invite  your questions and feedback and we will make ourselves available to make your stay a great one! We just ask that you limit any non-emergency interaction with us to between 8AM-8PM as we have young children. Please use the door bell at the front of the house--the back room of the main house is used for storage and we may not hear your knocks at that door.  You may also call or text us at our number:  (408) 417-6496.\n\nWhen you book with us, we will give you full privacy and not bother you unless you need our assistance.",

Charlene is an excellent communicator and was very quick to respond to any communication, as well as right on time to meet me on site to get me the keys. The Condo is spacious and clean. It is in a good location and the unit is close to its designated parking spot. Overall a great experience. One thing to be aware of for future visitors is that the largest bed available is I believe a Full Size. Just something to keep in mind for couples wishing to visit.",

Property was very clean and well maintained. It is spacious and has a lot of daylight that comes in. The washing machine was the amenity that I didn't know I needed. Peter even left single-use laundry tabs for use! The onsite facilities were very nice. I frequently used the business center and gym; had no complaints about them. The property itself is located walking distance from a great plaza. The plaza has great restaurants (Chipotle, RedRobin, Pizza, Subs) and a SafeWay. Anything that you need/want or forget, you can get within minutes. Peter was very welcoming. When arriving at the location; I arrived 30 minutes early, and peter was there within 5 minutes of me sending him a message. When I left, I was leaving at an odd time, but Peter again was very accommodating and met up at my requested time. Overall it was a great experience.

The house was a tiny and comfy one with very comfortable beds. The most useful was the backyard washing and drying unit which he let us use (We had a pile of laundry from our travels in the US which we didn't get time for before :P)   Roger also offered to take us on a tour of the cathedral he works at, but we didn't have time. We forgot to give him snacks and sweets we had got from India for his hospitality. (Sorry  Roger! ).  Regards, Vinayak",
